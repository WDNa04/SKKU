## Exercise
When a sentence is entered, if there are words that correspond to NG words, write a program that replaces each NG word with its replacement word specified. The NG words and their replacement words are given in ng_list. (['NG word', 'Replacement word'])

When filtering out NG words, case sensitivity is taken into account.

## Example
### input
<pre>
Input a sentence: I'm in Sadness.
