I want to find the number of real roots of a quadratic equation using the discriminant.

If we denote a quadratic equation as $ax^2+bx+c=0$, then the discriminant D is $D = b^2-4ac$. 

The number of real roots of a quadratic equation depends on the value of the discriminant D as follows.

| Value of D | The Number of Real Roots |
| :---: | :---: |
| D > 0 | 2 |
| D = 0 | 1 |
| D < 0 | 0 |

Write a program that takes the coefficients a, b, and c of a quadratic equation as input and outputs the number of real roots. **(Note that a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not 0.)**

*Example

<pre>
a = 3.3
b = 5.67
c = 2.152
