## Exercise
5 people are in a room at once in order. Write a program to find the thief among them. The program will work through the following steps:

### Step
1) Enter the occupations of the 5 people at once. The entered occupations will be saved in the job_list.
2) If 'thief' is among the entered occupations, print 'thief!'.
- However, if 'cop' is among the entered occupations during step 2, print 'busted'.
3) For all other cases, print 'peace'.

However, use the **append** command to put natural numbers in a list.
