## Exercise

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

$ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 $

Write a program that prints the value of n! when the program receives positive integer n. 

For example, if you enter the number 5, then program should print 120, which is $ 5\times4\times3\times2\times1$.

## Example
input
<pre>
Enter a number: 5
