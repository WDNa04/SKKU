## Exercise
I'm trying to implement a blackjack game as a program. The program operates in the following way.

1) Receive a natural number N as input.
2) Receive an integer between 1 and 13 as input.
3) If the sum of the numbers entered so far (excluding N) is **less than N**, repeat step 2. However, if the sum is **equal to N**, print "You won!!", and if the sum is **greater than N**, print "Game Over!" and end the program.

Implement this program. 

## Example
input
<pre>
N = 10
Number = 1
Number = 2
Number = 3
Number = 4
</pre>
output
<pre>
You won!!
</pre>
