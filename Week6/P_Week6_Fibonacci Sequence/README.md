## Exercise
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

Write a program that outputs the N terms in the Fibonacci sequence by receiving a natural number N. 

**(However, Fibonacci sequence starts from 1.)**

## Example
input
<pre>
Write the number N: 5
</pre>
output
<pre>
