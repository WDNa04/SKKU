### output
<pre>
In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
Then, God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
